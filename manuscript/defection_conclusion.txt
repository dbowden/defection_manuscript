# Conclusion

- Other aspects of military preparedness - do novel international threats lead to losses?
- Connection to conflict intensity - do governments became more dovish to prevent further defection? Or more hawkish as internal opponents are gone? Do rebels escalate as they perceive a new enemy? Or does civilian targeting lead to more recruits somewhat independently?
