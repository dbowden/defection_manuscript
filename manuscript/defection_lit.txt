# Prior Work on Regime Fragmentation

While some forms of political violence are often considered jointly, such as protests and civil war or civil and international war, coups d'etat are typically treated as distinct phenomenon, and are not considered jointly with other forms of violence.^[One notable exception is @Roessler2011.] Given examples such as the Free Syrian Army, however, I argue that there is considerable overlap between coups and civil wars. Thus, I analyze coups and rebellions that originate from the regime jointly under the umbrella term "regime fragmentation." 

<!-- Desertion is also an important form of regime fragmentation. While I am not able to capture this phenomenon empirically, I include it in my literature review as it may offer insights to the forms of fragmentation that are included in the analysis. -->

## Dissent, Repression, and Coups

The literature often conceptualizes coup attempts as coordination problems among elites [@Weeks2008; @Svolik2012d; @Powell2012a]. Protests can potentially solve this coordination problem by revealing the regime's ability to deter challenges [@Casper2014; @Johnson2018]. These signals are likely to be especially influential when protests are non-violent [@Johnson2018], occur in or near the national capital [@Johnson2018], and are amplified by a free press [@Casper2014]. Protests can also serve as a motive for coup attempts by signaling the illegitimacy of the regime [@Johnson2018], and enhance opportunities for successful coups by empowering the military [@Svolik2012e]. 

While protests are associated with a statistically-significant increase in the probability of coups [@Casper2014; @Johnson2018], responding to protests with force is not necessarily a wise choice for regimes. @Hendrix2017 argue that the use of repression can cause backlash within the military, and show that this possibility deters repressive tactics, particularly when coup-risk is especially, as is the case for militaries that have previously experienced infighting, and for protests which emphasize ethnic or religious identities. While this deterrent effect is substantial, a great deal of repression occurs nonetheless. Neither @Hendrix2017 nor any other study to my knowledge examines the reverse relationship assessing, in effect, whether the assumption that repression leads to regime fragmentation is correct. Furthermore, the use of repression is likely endogenous to potential reactions to its use [@Ritter2016]. The body of evidence on the relationship between repression and regime fragmentation would therefore be strengthened by analyses using causal identification techniques such as the instrumental variable analysis presented here.

## Repression and Civil War

Many scholars of political violence and human rights have examined the "repression-dissent nexus," often focusing on the role of government repression in escalating unrest. There is widespread agreement that repression can backfire and escalate dissident activities, though the conditions under which this occurs are contested. Early work in this area disaggregated dissident activity, showing that repression reduces non-violent dissent while increasing violent opposition [@Lichbach1987; @Moore1998]. @Rasler1996 emphasizes temporal dynamics, providing evidence that repression reduces dissident activity in the short-run while increasing it in the long-run. @Pierskalla2010 criticizes prior studies for their lack of attention to strategic interplay, and finds that escalation should only occur in the presence of a third-party threat. The preceding findings concern primarily the qualitative character of dissent, rather than the quantitative volume. The consistency of repressive or accommodative policies [@Lichbach1987], the forcefulness of repressive tactics [@Hegre2001; @Pierskalla2010], and prior history of civil conflict [@Bell2018] have been posited as explanations for the aggregate level of dissent.

The preceding studies generally define escalation in relative terms, leaving unclear the frequency with which the violence they observe aligns with scholarly definitions of civil war.^[Such definitions typically entail a minimum threshold of severity such as 25 fatalities per calendar year, a substantial degree of organization on both sides, and some amount of competitiveness between the two sides. For a  representative example, see @Pettersson2018.] However, several works do focus specifically on civil war as a form of escalation. Some scholars conceptualize repression and civil war as distinct equilibria [@Besley2009; @Choi2018]. The probability that repression is met by effective resistance (the civil war outcome) rather than remaining one-sided is shown to increase with the material value of winning control of the government [@Besley2009], decrease with the inclusiveness of political institutions [@Besley2009; @Choi2018], and increase with the size of the dominant ethnic group relative to the size of the minimum winning coalition [@Choi2018]. Others treat repression and civil war as sequential steps in a process of escalation. In this view, repression often proves counterproductive as it decreases support for the regime [@Young2013] and increases the probability of civil war. Interestingly, this relationship does not appear to be conditional on the efficacy of repression, as effective repression increases the risk of civil war by further inflaming tensions, while ineffective repression does so by emboldening dissidents [@Davenportnd]. In addition to being associated with the onset of civil conflict, repression predicts increased violence by existing rebel groups [@Shellman2013].

The studies reviewed here have consistently found a link between repression and the onset of civil conflict. However, tests of specific theoretical mechanisms have been less conclusive. A potential reason for this is that while all of the theories above assume that rebel groups emerge from non-state dissident movements, original data presented here reveals that a large number of rebellions included in commonly-used datasets are launched by members of the regime. Differences in the conditions under which repression produces these two types of rebellions could account for the inconclusive results on mechanisms observed thus far. This analysis could shed light on such a possibility.
