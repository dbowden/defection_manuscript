# Research Design

An underlying question in this analysis is whether the regime fragmentation observed during the Arab Spring was unique to that historical process, or something that has occurred frequently throughout time and space. A cross-national quantitative analysis that tests for such outcomes in a large sample is therefore a logical choice. While highly disaggregated analyses of political violence are increasingly common and often facilitate nuanced tests of theoretical mechanisms [e.g. @Hendrix2017], the datasets conducive to this sort of research tend to have limited spatial and temporal coverage. I thus elect to conduct my analysis at the country-year level, with a sample covering the entire world over the period 1946-2017. This provides an initial set of 10,713 cases, though due to missing data the number used in most analyses is slightly lower.

## Dependent Variables

*Coup Attempt* One form of regime fragmentation is coups d'etat. As I am primarily interested in the conditions under which members of the military possess a desire to effect change, I analyze coup attempts rather than coup success, which depends on a set of somewhat unrelated factors [@Powell2012a]. The dataset comes @Powell2011, who define a coup as an "illegal and overt attempts by the military or other
elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive," [@Powell2011, 252]. As coup attempts often cluster in space and time, I convert the coup list to a binary indicator that is equal to 1 for country-years in which a coup was attempted, and 0 otherwise. This yields 407 country-years with coup attempts.

*Regime-Based Rebellion* Some instances of regime fragmentation are not included in most coup datasets because they do not work through the state apparatus. For example, members of the Syrian Air Force turned against the Assad regime in 2011, but opted to form a rebel group (the Free Syrian Army) rather than operate through their roles within the state. I call this phenomenon "regime-based rebellion," and collect original data to measure it. I begin with a list of the rebel groups which appear in the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Dyadic Dataset (version 18.1) [@Pettersson2018]. Inclusion in the dataset requires that a rebel group was involved in fighting that produced at least 25 fatalities in at least one calendar year between 1946 and 2017. I then code the societal origin of the rebel group using a variety of primary and secondary sources. In cases of limited information, coding decisions are based on the previous roles of the rebel group's leader(s). Many rebel groups draw membership from multiple societal groups; in the present analysis I use only the origin that I deem to be the largest contributor of personnel. I code a rebel group as originating from the regime military if its membership is drawn primarily from individuals who were most recently employed by any branch of the regime security forces. Rebels who previously held civilian roles within the government are not included in the category.^[For complete coding rules, see @Bowden2017.] From these codings I construct a binary indicator for country-years in which a regime-based rebel group was formed. This is the case in 71 country-years. As many opposition movements employ a diversity of tactics, these overlap substantially with the coup variable - 46 of the country-years with a regime-based rebellion also have a coup.

## Independent Variables

*Latent Protection Score* I use two alternative measures to capture the concept of repression. The first is Latent Human Protection scores, version 2 [@Fariss2014; @Schnakenberg2014]. Most human rights datasets are derived from news coverage, creating the possibility for bias as the depth of coverage and standards against which human rights practices are evaluated might vary across space and time. To solve this, the authors combine thirteen of the most prominent scholarly human rights datasets in a Bayesian measurement model. This produces an estimate for each country-year based on a mix of the data for that particular year and the average score for that country and year. The absolute values of the measure are not inherently meaningful, but range from roughly -3.1 (most repressive) to 4.7 (most respectful of human rights). Examples of cases towards the more repressive end of the spectrum include Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had a score averaging around -2.5, and Sudan, which had scores around -3.0 during the genocide in Darfur.

*NAVCO Repression* The Latent Protection Scores are a useful measure of the general state of human rights in a given country-year, but by design smooth over temporary fluctuations in repression levels. To compensate for this blind spot, I include a direct measure of the repression of specific protests campaigns from the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) dataset (version 2.0) [@Chenoweth2013b; @Chenoweth2013a]. The dataset includes all known instances of sustained, purposive campaigns against a government or occupying force between 1946 and 2013. I utilize the "repression" variable, which codes the government response to a campaign on a four-point scale ranging from 0 (not repressive) to 3 (extreme repression). When multiple campaigns occur within a single country-year, I use the most repressive action observed.

*Percentage of Military from Discriminated Ethnic Groups* To test *Hypothesis 2* I construct a measure from the Security Forces Ethnicity (SFE) Dataset (version 1.0) [@Johnson2017]. The SFE data measures the ethnic composition of security forces in the Middle East, 1946--2013, providing approximate ethnic breakdowns of both the officer corps and rank-and-file. I combine this data with the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) Core Dataset 2018 [@Vogt2015], which codes the political status of each ethnic group worldwide, 1946-2017. I then construct a measure of the percentage of the rank-and-file membership that belong to an ethnic group facing discrimination (the "Discriminated" or "Powerless") codings on the "status" variable.

*Military Infighting* To test *Hypothesis 3* I include a binary indicator of whether conflict between military factions has occurred. The measure is constructed from the Historical Phoenix Event Data (version 1.0.0) [@Althaus2017]. Phoenix compiles political events through automated coding of news articles, recording the actors involved and classifying the event on the CAMEO events data coding scheme. I code the indicator as 1 for country-years in which there was at least one violent conflict between two actors associated with the government military.

## Control Variables

As coups have been shown to be most prevalent in relatively poor states [@Londregan1990], I include the per capita gross domestic product and population using data from @Gleditsch2002a (version 6.0 beta) for the period 1950-2011. Both measures are logged. Following @Johnson2018 I include binary indicators for autocratic and democratic regimes (leaving anocracy as the residual category) using data from the Polity IV project [@Marshall2016], and a binary indicator for military regimes using from the Autocratic Regime Data [@Geddes2014a]. Lastly, I control for ongoing civil conflicts, including all conflicts producing at least 25 fatalities in a calendar year as reported by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Armed Conflict Data [@Pettersson2018].

## Model

As both dependent variables are binary, I estimate panel logistic regression models. Because I am primarily interested in the effect of changes within countries, I use a fixed-effects estimator. To help ensure that the explanatory variables cause regime fragmentation rather than the reverse, all independent variables and controls are lagged by one year. For robustness I estimate instrumental variables probit models, discussed in detail below.
