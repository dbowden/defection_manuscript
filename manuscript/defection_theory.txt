# Theorizing Regime Fragmentation

Prior work has demonstrated an empirical link between protests and coup onset. Repression plays a crucial, but often untested role in the accompanying theoretical models. The governmentâ€™s response to unrest is thought to reveal information about its strength, increasing the probability that potential coup plotters will be able to coordinate their actions [@Casper2014; @Johnson2018]. In this view, all else equal, high levels of repression should reduce the probability of coups and rebellions by signaling that the government is strong. I argue that this approach is overly focused on the informational role of protests and coups, and overlooks the possibility that repression could alter preferences over challenging the government.

While the use of repression demonstrates a certain degree of military strength, backlash to its use can weaken the regime in a variety of ways. @Belkin2003 argue that losing legitimacy in the eyes of the populace is a prerequisite for coups. As a government becomes more repressive, it should tend to lose legitimacy and support among citizens. It  does not necessarily follow that regime opponents will experience a concomitant gain in legitimacy and popularity, particularly if they played a role in applying the repression. Nevertheless, opponents should gain strength relative to the regime as pro-government mobilization becomes less likely. The regime may also lose international support as it engages in repression. Human rights violations are often met with economic sanctions, and there is evidence that human rights practices inform consumer choices [@Cao2013]. Although sanctions do not seem to be effective at deterring human rights abuses [@Wood2008a], they may have dramatic consequences for internal regime politics. Many regimes maintain the loyalty of their security force by providing material benefits [@Belkin2003; @Powell2012a], often financed through non-tax revenue sources such as foreign aid and natural resource rents [@Morrison2009]. If these revenue streams are disrupted in response to repression, the incentives for soldiers to continue supporting the regime are reduced.

<!-- Lastly, soldiers may be personally troubled by the use of repression. Many states use conscription to fill the ranks of their militaries, and volunteers often join out of a desire to defend their state from external threats. Turning their weapons against their fellow citizens might  -->

In short, I expect that repression and the regime's power share a paradoxical relationship. While the successful use of repression is indicative of a strong regime, it also tends to set regimes on a path toward a relative decline in power. Repression should therefore be positively related to the incidence of coups and regime-based rebellions.

## Ethnic Ties

Ethnicity and religion are the most influential ordering principles in many societies worldwide [@Robinson2014], shaping aspects of life ranging from fundamental tasks such as local-level collective action [@Habyarimana2007] to broad political patterns such as party preference [@Wantchekon2003]. Identity has often been the basis for protests [@Jazayeri2016; @Salehyan2017] and violent conflict between societal groups and the state [@Cederman2013a]. This creates many opportunities for repression, which might be an especially likely response when a state faces multiple potential identity-based challenges [@Walter2006a].

Soldiers should be especially likely to rebel against the regime when asked to repress members of their own ethnic group. Evidence suggests that unusually dense network ties between members are a key reason for the unique role that ethnic groups often play in politics [@Habyarimana2007]. Thus, soldiers may have some degree of social connection to the co-ethnic targets of repression, which might reduce their inclination to carry out orders, and may lead them to leave their posts to defend their families or communities. Even in the absence of direct social ties, orders to target co-ethnics may give soldiers pause because ethnic groups are often defined in part by a sense of "linked fate" [@Kuran1998]. Soldiers may fear that a repressive campaign against dissident members of their ethnic group could eventually turn against them. Ethnic identity has been shown to be malleable in response to the political climate [@Eifert2010], meaning that even if soldiers did not identify strongly with their ethnic group previously, they may begin to do so in response to the repression of co-ethnics.

The preceding logic suggests that the risk of coups and rebellions from the regime should increase with the proportion of the military that shares a common identity with the individuals being targeted with repression. I expect this effect to increase with the severity of repression. Thus, I hypothesize an interaction effect between the level of repression and the extent of ethnic ties between the military and the repressed.

## Organizational Control

One of the most commonly-cited categories of explanation for coups is the degree of organizational control within the military. Unsuccessful coup plotters tend to be punished harshly. The probability of coup attempts should therefore decrease as the regime's ability to withstand challenges and apprehend participants. Militaries with high levels of command and control may even be able to prevent coup attempts altogether by disrupting the ability of dissatisfied members to coordinate. There is some disagreement about the conditions under which militaries achieve such control. @Belkin2003 view the fragmentation of the military into multiple branches or factions as an effective form of coup-proofing, as it reduces the likelihood of successful coordination amongst a wide swath of the military, while @Powell2012a finds that most measures of factionalism are not significant predictors of coups. One reason for this discrepancy appears to be that not all intra-military divisions are created equal, as @Hendrix2017 find indirect evidence that infighting between military factions increases the risk of coups. Building on their work, I expect that manifest disunity within the military in the form of infighting should amplify the effect of repression. This should be observable as a statistically significant interaction effect between repression and the occurrence of conflict within the military.
